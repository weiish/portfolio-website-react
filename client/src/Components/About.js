            I'm a self-taught developer with experience in a variety of languages. I've been inseparable from technology since a young age, and I'm eager to continue building my career around it. Programming gives us the ability to create anything, from tools, to automation, to experiences and entertainment. However, just creating isn't enough. When I get to share one of my creations with someone and it makes something easier for them, or frees up some of their time, or brings a smile to their face, that's when I've succeeded. And of course, just delivering is often not enough. I strive to take feedback into account and polish my work. 
          </p>
          <p>
            All this being said, I still believe I have a lot to learn. Which is why I'm looking for a role that will give me opportunities to interact with experienced developers and challenging, meaningful projects that will push my boundaries as a developer. I'm a problem solver and an avid learner, and I want to learn how I can help with what YOU'RE working on.
